# Computer Networks Projects

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains projects related to **Computer Networks**, including a practical project on Linux server setup and a research project on Software-Defined Networking (SDN).

## 🖥️ Practical Project - Linux Server

### 📌 Description

This project aims to install and configure a **Linux server** (or BSD-based system) accessible through the campus laboratory network, following the requirements defined in class.

### ✅ Project Requirements

- Server accessible through the laboratory network.
- Use of a **Linux or BSD operating system** chosen by the group.
- Installation and configuration of a **DBMS** (Database Management System).
- Support for **Java applications with database access** and deployment of a **Java Web application** (e.g., Tomcat).
- HTTP server configured with support for **PHP and database** (e.g., Apache HTTP, Nginx).
- Installation and availability of an **open source web application** via network (ERP, CRM, CMS, or LMS).
- All systems and applications must be installed and configured by the group members.
- Delivery of detailed documentation with the **step-by-step process** or optionally a video link demonstrating the execution.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Operating System: **(define which one was chosen, e.g., Ubuntu Server / Debian / FreeBSD / etc.)**
- DBMS: **(e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, etc.)**
- Java Web Server: **(e.g., Apache Tomcat, WildFly, etc.)**
- HTTP Server: **(e.g., Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, etc.)**
- Open Source Web Application: **(e.g., WordPress, Moodle, Odoo, etc.)**

## 📚 Research Project - Software-Defined Networking (SDN)

### 📌 Research Overview

This repository contains a research project on **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**, exploring its concepts, architecture, benefits, and applications.

### ✅ Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of SDN.
- Analyze the architecture: Control Plane, Data Plane, and Application Plane.
- Discuss advantages and challenges of SDN in modern networks.
- Explore real-world use cases and tools (e.g., OpenFlow, Mininet, ONOS).
